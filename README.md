Above is my first build of a helix antenna described in [W6NBC's paper in QST](https://w6nbc.com/articles/2011-06QST2mhelices.pdf). Roughly speaking it would fit in a 200cm sided cube, and it definitely fits inside the non-functional decorative GRP chimney pot on my house (i.e. right at the top in the circular pot, not the square section below).

This repo is new as of 30th June 2025 and will be developed if my experiments with stacking these antennas is successful. Amongst the folders are NEC files with dimensions, and results.
